== Overview

A tiny (microscopic even) experiment with a user mode Multics. Currently implemented in Python3, mostly for ease of porting
and use of dbm. Inspiration from a few different sources:

. Multics, obviously, but also PR1MOS and Stratus VOS
. GEORGE3/4
. Poplog

This is also an experiment for me to test out some of the ideas I was thinking about in SemaforOS.

== Usage

Currently, you just need Python3, and whatever `+dbm+` module is currently installed; that should normally be backed by
`+gdbm+`, but it should work regardless. To start the executive, just run `+python3 exec.py+`, which will drop you
into a shell:

----
% python3 exec.py <1>
>system.dir
>udd.dir
# Tue Feb 15 07:23:44 2022 <2>
getcwd <3>
>udd>lojikil <4>
# Tue Feb 15 07:23:47 2022
ld <5>
Directories: <6>
work
docs
Segments:

# Tue Feb 15 07:24:57 2022
----
<1> Invocation
<2> The `+exec+` prompt
<3> `getcwd` get the current working directory
<4> We're currently in `>udd>lojikil`
<5> `ld` list directory
<6> The result is two directories and no segments/files

== Current status

Currently, this is basically just a simple disk operating system shell (DOS shell). I went this route because that's how
most operating systems of the era were written: start with a DOS, then add a Shell, then add all the stuff you actually
want to support. My thoughts here are something like BOS, USCD Pascal, and Inferno could be really interesting, all in
a simple set of files. Make it easily hackable, easily approachable, and restartable

== Ideas

I've been thinking heavily about how do we make a multi-user version of this? Obvious, a dbm-based version can easily be made
multi-user, but Python and multi-user is... suspect. The thought struck me, however:

. use the packs as the arbiter combined with the kernel:
.. each user runs their own executive
.. this enforces the constraints stored within the packs
.. packs are then shared amongst users, but executives aren't
.. thus, we really only to make sure that the ACLs, TLPs, and MAC/RBACs are followed in the executive
.. and that users cannot modify the executive (obviously)
.. we can also back up our MAC/RBACs with the host operating system/Datastore
.. for example, ACLs in Raft could back up what we use in the OS itself
.. someone with SysAdmin privs should be able to set those... maybe cluster privs?
.. *OH* this is what Multics and older computers called "front-end processors..."
.. Web front-ends can use Status VOS display-only mode can be used...
.. Need a mapping from applications to display forms
.. Also, make it functions as a service... make web-endpoints for things too
.. Aka, it's a Information Utility
. We can make this "cloud native" scale by using external key-value stores, like Raft
.. Raft stores our file system, segments, metadata
.. CPU executives then interact with the remote single-level store
. Ports, Printers, &c are stored within the packs
.. obviously these are just things that are written to & read from, almost pub-sub style
. User journaling
.. one thing I'm passionate about is just saving the state of the world
.. users should literally be able to destroy their device and restart as if nothing happend
.. we can do this by journaling application state from time to time to a location in the pack(s)
.. thus a user only loses up to the last journal time at any given time
.. similarly, we can track what opened a file last; a user can then just use the `open` command with a file
.. or they can access their "recently viewed" files easily. it should be part of the system
. API
.. I need to read more about the multics programming env, it looks interesting
.. but I also know that what VOS called `program modules` are the way I want to go, like Inferno
.. Modules + `main` == Programs: if a module has a `main`, it can be run, but also loaded
.. Need to figure out how to work with segments
. Groups vs Projects
.. All users have groups
.. They also have special mandatory access groups called Projects
.. Projects can have special roles attached, like in Multics
. Poplog, RavenWorks
.. Common Language Runtime
.. StandardML, Pop-11 (simple JS-like language), Oberon
