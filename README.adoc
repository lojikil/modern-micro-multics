== Overview

A tiny (microscopic even) experiment with a user mode Multics. Currently implemented in Python3, mostly for ease of porting
and use of dbm. Inspiration from a few different sources:

. Multics, obviously, but also PR1MOS and Stratus VOS
. GEORGE3/4
. Poplog

This is also an experiment for me to test out some of the ideas I was thinking about in SemaforOS.
